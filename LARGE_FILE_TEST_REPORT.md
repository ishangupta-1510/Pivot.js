# Large CSV File Upload Test Report
## Test Date: 2025-08-30

## Test Overview
Comprehensive testing of uploading and processing a large CSV file (100,000 rows × 100 columns) to the backend system.

## Test File Specifications

### File Details
- **Filename**: test-100K-100col.csv
- **File Size**: 143.69 MB (150,671,361 bytes)
- **Dimensions**: 100,000 rows × 100 columns
- **Total Cells**: 10,000,000 data points
- **Generation Time**: 29.14 seconds

### Data Types Distribution
The test file contains mixed data types to simulate real-world scenarios:
- **Strings**: Product names, categories, regions, statuses, customer IDs, vendor IDs, SKUs
- **Numbers**: Decimals, integers, calculated values, prices, quantities, percentages
- **Dates**: ISO format, US format, full ISO timestamps, year-month format
- **Booleans**: true/false values
- **Emails**: Valid email format
- **Currencies**: Multiple currency symbols with amounts
- **Percentages**: Decimal percentages
- **Phone Numbers**: US format phone numbers
- **URLs**: Valid HTTP URLs
- **JSON**: Embedded JSON objects

## Test Results

### 1. File Upload Performance

#### Upload Metrics
- **Upload Duration**: 7-8 seconds
- **Upload Speed**: 17-18 MB/s
- **Protocol**: HTTP POST with multipart/form-data
- **Authentication**: x-api-key header
- **Endpoint**: `/api/v1/upload/csv`

#### Upload Status
✅ **SUCCESSFUL** - File uploaded without errors

### 2. Backend Health Check

#### System Status
- **Overall Health**: ✅ Healthy
- **Database**: ✅ Healthy
- **Redis Cache**: ✅ Healthy
- **Queue System**: Active
- **WebSocket Events**: Connected

### 3. Processing Status

#### Job Creation
- **Job IDs Created**: Multiple jobs successfully created
- **Initial Status**: Processing initiated
- **Queue Management**: Jobs properly queued

#### Processing Observations
- Multiple upload jobs created (f3eb7e53-f8f5-4f4f-ba9f-6c7414fcece4, 74d5a7bf-0791-4cf2-a80c-598ee6f7fb08)
- Jobs remain in "processing" status for large files
- System handles concurrent upload requests

### 4. Memory Usage

#### Client-Side Memory
- **Initial RSS**: ~50 MB
- **Initial Heap**: ~9 MB
- **During Upload**: Stable memory usage
- **Peak Memory**: Within acceptable limits

### 5. Performance Characteristics

#### Strengths
1. **Fast Upload Speed**: 17-18 MB/s is excellent for large files
2. **Stable Connection**: No connection drops during upload
3. **Proper Job Queuing**: System correctly queues large files for processing
4. **Concurrent Support**: Multiple uploads can be handled simultaneously

#### Areas for Optimization
1. **Processing Time**: Large files take significant time to process (still processing after several minutes)
2. **Progress Tracking**: Progress remains at 0% during initial processing phase
3. **Row Estimation**: totalRowsEstimated is null during processing

## Test Scripts Created

### 1. Data Generator (`generate-large-test-data.mjs`)
- Generates configurable CSV files with mixed data types
- Memory-efficient batch writing
- Progress tracking during generation

### 2. Quick Upload Test (`quick-large-upload-test.mjs`)
- Simplified upload test with progress tracking
- Real-time upload progress display
- Job status monitoring

### 3. Comprehensive Test (`test-large-upload.mjs`)
- Full test suite with multiple checks
- Performance metrics collection
- Memory usage tracking
- Concurrent request testing

## Recommendations

### Performance Improvements
1. **Streaming Processing**: Implement streaming CSV parsing to handle large files more efficiently
2. **Progress Updates**: Provide real-time progress updates during processing
3. **Batch Processing**: Process CSV in chunks to prevent memory overflow
4. **Worker Threads**: Use worker threads for CPU-intensive parsing

### Monitoring Enhancements
1. **Progress Granularity**: Report processing progress at regular intervals
2. **Row Count Estimation**: Quickly estimate total rows for better progress tracking
3. **Memory Monitoring**: Track backend memory usage during processing

### Error Handling
1. **Timeout Configuration**: Implement configurable timeouts for large file processing
2. **Partial Processing**: Support resumable uploads for very large files
3. **Error Recovery**: Implement retry logic for failed processing attempts

## Conclusion

The system successfully handles large CSV file uploads with good upload speeds (17-18 MB/s). The backend properly queues and initiates processing for files with 10 million data points. However, processing time for such large files is significant, and progress tracking could be improved.

### Test Status: ✅ PASSED with observations

The upload functionality works correctly, but processing optimization is recommended for production use with large datasets.

## Test Artifacts
